# CS310 - Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and projects completed for CS310: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at UMass Boston.

## About the Project

In this course, I explored advanced topics in data structures and algorithms, building upon foundational computer science concepts. The work in this repository showcases my understanding and implementation of various complex data structures and algorithmic techniques commonly used in software engineering and technical interviews.

### What I Did

- Implemented and analyzed advanced data structures such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, B-trees, heaps, and graphs.
- Developed algorithms for searching, sorting, and graph traversal (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.).
- Solved challenging problems involving dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer approaches.
- Completed practical coding assignments and larger projects that demonstrate the application of these concepts to real-world scenarios.
- Documented code with explanations and created test cases to verify correctness and efficiency.
- Collaborated with classmates on coding exercises and discussed different approaches to problem-solving.
- Benchmarked and compared the performance of different data structures and algorithms using empirical analysis.
- Utilized debugging and profiling tools to optimize code and understand algorithmic complexity.
- Wrote comprehensive reports and reflections for each assignment, explaining the design decisions made and lessons learned.
- Practiced writing clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices in software development.
